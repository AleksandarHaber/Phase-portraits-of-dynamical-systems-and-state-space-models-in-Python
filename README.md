# Phase-portraits-of-dynamical-systems-and-state-space-models-in-Python

In this Python dynamical system tutorial, we explain how to construct phase portraits of dynamical systems and state-space models. The posted code will construct a phase portrait and a state-space trajectory of a dynamical system. 
The webpage tutorial accompanying these codes is given here:
